## Hygiene

### Acne Control

- Buy a cloth facemask to keep your hands off of your face after you come home from work or school. Keep it on while you sleep. Wash as needed. 
	- [Here is the one that I bought on amazon.](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MAY6HCJ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
- Bring daily (prescribed?) acne cream with you and put on at work/school if you don't have time in bathroom in the morning
- Buy 100%-99% pure Aloe Vera. If it doesn't say a percentage, its probably low percentage and they filled the rest with glycerin or some other gel.
- *Don't touch your face.* This is actually one of the most difficult challenges I've ever faced. I haven't been successful.

### Shaving

- Shave with an electric shaver to prevent cuts, have less prep and clean up, and finish faster. Some people use blade for perfectly clean shave but you are more likely to get ingrown hairs from perfect shave. Buy waterproof shaver if you shave body in shower.
- Shave your groin, armpits, beard when they get long enough that the hairs start to trap oil. This way when you sweat these areas won't smell, when you apply deodorant it won't coagulate and get crusty, and your skin will feel better. Some guys will disagree with this but this is how my dad raised me.

## Lifestyle
